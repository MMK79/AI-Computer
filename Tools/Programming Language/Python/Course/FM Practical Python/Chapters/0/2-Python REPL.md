Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop. It allows you to interactively type in Python program line by line.
Pros: Good for learning + instead of having test.py, you can use this
Cons: Can't save them, it's a scratch area.
`>>>` indicate that you are in the REPL, lines without them are output
`#` comment in python, will get ignore by interpreter
```
python
>>>name = 'Masoud'
>>>name
Masoud
```
or
```
>>> x = 5
>>> y = 33.5
>>> x * y
167.5
```
* `ctrl+d` to exit REPL, or `exit()` function
* Inside files we use `print()` function instead
