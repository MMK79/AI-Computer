* int
* float; you have valid float which means `0.` (no syntax error, but confusing)
* complex; end with j, `12j`
> [!important] You can convert types with casting them
> `int(3.0)`, `float(3)`
* for integer division use `//` instead of `/` (float division)
* Parentheses to make sure of the order
> [!important] What is built in modules?
modules that you don't need to import to use
