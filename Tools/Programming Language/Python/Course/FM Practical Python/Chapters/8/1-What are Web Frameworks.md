Web frameworks are designed to support creating web applications while simplifying and abstracting lots of things that are happening under the hood. Allow you to build the application itself.

> [!important] Difference between Frameworks and Libraries/Modules: Inversion of control
> With Framework, Framework is a skeleton and you as a programmer will provide flesh, Framework is in control
> With Libraries, You do all the job, you are in control
