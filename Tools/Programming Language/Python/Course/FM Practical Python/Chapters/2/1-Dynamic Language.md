Python is a Dynamic Language, You just create a variable without stating what kind of variable it will be, and even it can change through your program to another data type too (type does not need to be consistent);
```
x = 5 # no defenition that this x is integer
x = "hi" # change its type of value without doing anything
```
* It can cause bugs! $\xrightarrow{solution}$ You need to be careful with your variable naming; Be as explicit as you can be, Be Descriptive as possible
> [!important] Snake-Casing: all lower case, and separate with underscore (_)
